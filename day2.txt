Q1 What is an Operating System and what all functions are provided by
Operating System?

An Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) 
between the user and computer hardware. The purpose of an
operating system is to provide a platform on which a user
can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner. 

Important functions of an operating System: 

1.Security – 
The operating system uses password protection to 
protect user data and similar other techniques. 
it also prevents unauthorized access to programs and user data. 

 
2.Control over system performance – 
Monitors overall system health to help improve performance.
 records the response time between service requests
 and system response to having a complete view of the system health.
This can help improve performance by providing important information
 needed to troubleshoot problems. 
 
2.Job accounting – 
Operating system Keeps track of time and resources used by various 
tasks and users, this information can be used to track resource 
usage for a particular user or group of users. 
 
4.Error detecting aids – 
The operating system constantly monitors the system to detect errors
 and avoid the malfunctioning of a computer system. 
 
5.Coordination between other software and users – 
Operating systems also coordinate and assign interpreters,
 compilers, assemblers, and other software to the various
 users of the computer systems. 
 
6.Memory Management – 
The operating system manages the Primary Memory or Main Memory.
 Main memory is made up of a large array of bytes or words where 
each byte or word is assigned a certain address. 
 


 
 

7.Processor Management – 
In a multi-programming environment, the OS decides the order 
in which processes have access to the processor, and how
 much processing time each process has. This function of
 OS is called process scheduling. 


 

8.Device Management – 
An OS manages device communication via their respective drivers. 
It performs the following activities for device management.
 Keeps track of all devices connected to the system. 


9.File Management – 
A file system is organized into directories for efficient

 or easy navigation and usage. These directories may 
contain other directories and other files.

Q2 What is a process? Explain Priority Scheduling and Round
Robin(RR) Scheduling algorithms.

A process is basically a program in execution. 
The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.


A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to
 be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms.
 There are six popular process scheduling algorithms 


1.First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
2.Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
3.Priority Scheduling
4.Shortest Remaining Time
5.Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
6.Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling
 
----------------------------------
3.Priority Scheduling-




1.Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm 
and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems.


2.Each process is assigned a priority. 
Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on.


3.Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis.


4.Priority can be decided based on memory requirements,
 time requirements or any other resource requirement.

Given: 
1.Table of processes,
2 and their Arrival time,
3.Execution time, 
4.and priority. 
----------------------------------------------------------

 
Round Robin Scheduling-

1.Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.

2.Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.

3.Once a process is executed for a given time period, 
it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period.

4.Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.

Q3 List some basic features of Linux Operating System.

LINUX is also an example of operating system. Linux was developed 

from UNIX to make the source code available on the internet.

Features-

1. Multiuser Operating System :

Q4 What is Kernel in Linux ?

 The Linux kernel is the foundation of the Linux 
computer operating system. A kernel is the lowest
 level of software that can interface with computer
 hardware. All
 Linux applications and servers also interface with the Linux kernel.

Q Explain below listed principles with examples among
SOLID principles.
● S: Single-responsibility principle
● O: Open-closed principle
● I: Interface segregation principle
=======================================================
Single Responsibility Principle-

The single responsibility principle states that every 
Java class must perform a single functionality. 
Implementation of multiple functionalities in a 
single class mashup the code and if any
 modification is required may affect the whole class. 
It precise the code and the code can be easily maintained.
 Let's understand the single responsibility 


------------------------------------------------
The application or module entities the methods,
 functions, variables, etc. The open-closed
 principle states that according to new requirements 
the module should be open for extension but 
closed for modification. The extension allows
 us to implement new functionality to the module.
 

------------------------------------------------------
The principle states that the larger interfaces split into smaller ones.
 Because the implementation classes use only the methods that are required.
 We should not force the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.


The goal of the interface segregation principle is similar to the 
single responsibility principle.
